# cgmlst-dists

Calculate distance matrix from 
cgMLST allele call tables of ChewBBACA

## Quick Start

```
% cat test/boring.tab

FILE    G1      G2      G3      G4      G5      G6
S1      1       INF-2   3       2       1       5
S2      1       1       1       1       NIPH    5
S3      1       2       3       4       1       3
S4      1       LNF     2       4       1       3
S5      1       2       ASM     2       1       3
S6      2       INF-8   3       PLOT3   PLOT5   3     

% cgmlst-dists test/boring.tab > distances.tab

This is cgmlst-dists 0.4.0
Loaded 6 samples x 6 allele calls
Calulating distances... 100.00%
Done.

% cat distances.tab

        S1      S2      S3      S4      S5
S1      0       3       2       3       1
S2      3       0       4       3       3
S3      2       4       0       1       1
S4      3       3       1       0       1
S5      1       3       1       1       0
S6      3       4       2       2       2
```

Any allelle calls that are not positive integers are converted to zero.
The distance is the 
[hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
but with zeroes excluded.

It works by replacing any alphabet characters,
and the strings `PLOT5` and `PLOT3` with spaces.
It then converts the remaining tab separated
values to integers and ignoring negative signs.
Anything weird is set to zero.

## Installation

`cgmlst-dists` is written in C and has no other dependencies.

### Homebrew
```
brew install brewsci/bio/cgmlst-dists  # COMING IN NOV 2020
```

### Bioconda
```
conda install -c bioconda cgmlst-dists
```

### Source

```
git clone https://github.com/tseemann/cgmlst-dists.git
cd cgmlst-dists
make

# run tests
make check

# optionally install to a specific location (default: /usr/local)
make PREFIX=/usr/local install
```

## Options

### `cgmlst-dists -h` (help)

```
SYNOPSIS
  Pairwise CG-MLST distance matrix from allele call tables
USAGE
  cgmlst-dists [options] chewbbaca.tab > distances.tsv
OPTIONS
  -h    Show this help
  -v    Print version and exit
  -q    Quiet mode; do not print progress information
  -c    Use comma instead of tab in output
  -m N  Output: 1=lower-tri 2=upper-tri 3=full [3]
  -x N  Stop calculating beyond this distance [9999]
URL
  https://github.com/tseemann/cgmlst-dists
```

### `cgmlst-dists -v` (version)

Prints the name and version separated by a space in standard Unix fashion.

```
cgmlst-dists 0.4.0
```

### `cgmlst-dists -q` (quiet mode)

Don't print informational messages, only errors.

### `cgmlst-dists -c` (CSV mode)

Use a comma instead of a tab in the output table.

### `cgmlst-dists -m N` (output matrix format)

The output matrix is diagonal symmetric because _dist(A,B)=dist(B,A)_.
This means we only calculate half the matrix and mirror it.
You can choose to output the lower triangle, upper triangle, or both:
* `-m 1` lower triangle only
* `-m 2` upper triangle only
* `-m 3` both triangle / full matrix (default)

### `cgmlst-dists -x N` (short-circuit divergent pairs)

The slowest part of the algorithm is calculating the distance
between two allele vectors. This option will stop comparing as
soon as the distance (differences) exceeds `-x`, and return
the distance as `-x`.
